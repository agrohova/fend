# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

This project is part of the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program offered by Udacity. The goal of this project is to build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. The tool will provide information about the article's subjectivity, polarity, and text snippet.

## How to Run the App

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the project directory.
3. Obtain an API key from Meaning Cloud by signing up on their website.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key using the following format: `API_KEY=your_api_key`.
5. Start the development server by running `npm run start`.
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the app.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structure similar to the one taught in the lessons. The main files and folders in the project are:

- `src` folder: Contains the source code for the app.
    - `server.js`: The server file that handles API requests and serves the app.
    - `index.js`: The entry point for the client-side JavaScript code.
    - `styles` folder: Contains the SCSS files for styling the app.
    - `views` folder: Contains the HTML file for the app's user interface.
- `dist` folder: Contains the bundled and optimized code generated by Webpack for production.

## Testing

The project uses Jest for testing. To run the tests, use the command `npm run test`.

## Offline Functionality

The project includes service workers for offline functionality. The Workbox plugin is implemented in `webpack.prod.js`, and the service worker is called from `index.html`. After visiting the site once, you should be able to turn off the server, refresh the page, and still see content.

## Interactions

The app includes a single-field form for entering the URL of the article to be analyzed. The form input is validated to ensure it is not blank.
