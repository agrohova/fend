## Project description
This project required to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

The project was a part of the Udacity Nano Degree Front End Web Developer and was created from example code provided by Udacity.

Functionalities added to the page:
- 4 sections of content (4 - 7) were added dynamically
- navbar added dynamically, sections linked
- active class to mark a section that's in the viewport
- slow scrolling to anchor
- responsive layout for small mobile devices

Project was submitted for review on May 29th 2023. All the javascript code was written by me.
